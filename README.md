## How to use

To use the full project:

1. Clone project
2. Remove git history - `rm -rf .git`
3. Rename project (in `package.json` once and in `package-lock.json` twice)
4. Install dependencies - `npm install`

Or you can also just take specific files or folders, e.g. the `style` folder or `footer` component.
